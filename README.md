This repo contains all the projects I have done in my Further Education at UniGap, bootcamp: Big Data Engineering

Project 1: This project uses basic built-in Linux command-line tools to quickly sort, filter, and analyze a movie dataset. It creates a simple, repeatable workflow to pull out key information without extra software.
