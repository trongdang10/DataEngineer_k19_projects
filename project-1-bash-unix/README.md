This project limited on tool we are allowed to use. We are encouraged to use awk() command :)

**Context:** The data is stored on a Linux server. The Data Engineering team needs to use Linux command-line tools to support the following tasks in order to obtain basic information about the dataset:
	1.	Sort the movies by release date in descending order and save the result to a new file.
	2.	Filter the movies with an average rating above 7.5 and save them to a new file.
	3.	Identify the movie with the highest revenue and the one with the lowest revenue.
	4.	Calculate the total revenue of all movies.
	5.	List the top 10 movies with the highest profit.
	6.	Determine which director has the most movies and which actor appears in the most movies.
	7.	Generate statistics on the number of movies by genre. For example, how many movies fall under Action, Family, etc.
	8.	Your own ideas for additional analysis on this dataset?
